## Submitting your style ##

When submitting your style you need three files.

1. The style xml-file with all the styles you want to commit as a package.
2. A JSON file describing the style(-s). A template for this file is below this list.
3. A 800x600 PNG image that showcase the style(-s). Only one image for each style.

All files must have identical basename and the extensions -xml, -json and -png.

All files committed must be releasable as public domain CC-0

### JSON ###

	"styleName": "Name of your style package",
	"creator": "Your Name",
	"keywords": ["list", "with", "keywords"],
	"styleDescription": "Here you put a short description of the style and if there's any specifics on how to apply it."
}
```
